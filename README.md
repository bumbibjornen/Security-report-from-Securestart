<h1>Security report from "Securestart"</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This report consists of an analysis of a fictional law firm called HRC where my team and I examined their IT security. 
<br/>
Their requests were:
<br/>
- <i>Finding vulnerabilities in their current systems</i>
<br/>
- <i>How HRC can minimize the risks to their employees who work from home</i>
<br/>
- <i>The cyber risks that exist when HRC moves to a cloud solution</i>
<br/>
- <i>What HRC needed to consider when migrating to a cloud service</i>
<br/>
I will go through their previous architecture and our recommended one as well as Azure architecture. Risk analysis and overall recommendations for their security safety since they handle sensitive information.

<b>PLEASE NOTE</b> - The report is in Swedish!
<h2>Tools Used </h2>
- <b>Risk analysis</b>
<br/>
- <b>Risk calculation</b>
<br/>
- <b>Frameworks: NIST, ISO27001, NIS directive</b>
<br/>
- <b>Guidelines & Policies</b>
<br/>

    My team and I used the risk analysis tool to help us analyse the different hardware and software they were using to see if it needed any upgrades or just recommendations.

    We developed a more improved network structure. It had more segmentation, improved hardware and software such as Windows Server 2022, Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) like FortiGuard, Fortigate 100F firewall and more.

    In the attachments, we had also policies for IT Security for the employees to have clear guidelines at the workplace but also when working remotely and Patch Management describes the necessary requirements that exist in order to be able to maintain updated systems and software on the IT systems
